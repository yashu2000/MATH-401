Applications of Linear Algebra

Hello World! In this repository are projects I worked on related to the mathematical foundations of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Harmonic Analysis, and Artificial Intelligence. I have a breakdown below:

**Projects Related to Deep Learning**
1. Linear Layers
2. Markov Chains (Generative Models)
3. Convolutions

**Projects Related to Machine Learning/Optimization Techniques**
1. Least Squares
2. Linear Progoramming
3. Curve Fitting
4. Singular Value Decomposition

**Projects Related to Artificial Intelligence**
1. Game Theory
2. Team Ranking
3. Random Walks (can be including in ML too but I am considering symmetric simulation based models to be a part of overall AI)

**Projects Related to Computer Vision/Graphics**
1. Perspective
2. Polyhedra
3. Image Compression
